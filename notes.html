		<h2>How Could I Improve</h2>
		<p>While I'm overall pleased with how my portfolio website looks right now, I do wish that I could further the design
		to be look even better. Being pressed for time with the project's deadline, as well as other projects I need to work
		on, I kept most of the design from last project and just worked to improve what was wrong last time and add what I
		learned since then. JavaScript has a lot of potentially interesting applications that I would've liked to add as well
		as learn what it can truly do. Image galleries were a bit of a pain, and didn't work with SPA (the error I noticed but
		was in the dark with trying to solve it). I ended up only having the default page on my projects page use an image gallery.
		I also wish I had more projects and other stuff that I could've added to website to flesh it out and make it look more
		professional.</p>
