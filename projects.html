			<h1>3D Modelling & Scene</h1>
			<h3>Team Members: Myself, Megan Smith, Muriel Hagge, Ryan Spencer</h3>
			<img src="images/atst.jpg" alt="AT-ST Model" class="printonly"/>
			<p>For this project, we needed to make a cohesive scene within Unity with models we needed to make and import
			into Unity. For my team, we made objects and a scene based on the Battle of Endor scene from the 6th Star Wars
			movie. The above image is a picture of one of the things I made, which was an AT-ST. For this model, I needed to
			use multiple shapes to make to create it due to the original inspiration having multiple, robotic parts.</p>
			<img src="images/lightsaber.jpg" alt="Lightsaber Model" class="printonly"/>
			<p>The model above is a lightsaber, based specifically on the one Luke Skywalker used. The reference for this
			model was his lightsaber. Unlike the AT-ST, this was made using a single cylinder model. I needed to manually
			create edges as I worked in order to shape it properly, as well as having to constantly use the extrusion tool.</p>
			<img src="images/3dScene.jpg" alt="Unity Scene" class="printonly"/>
			<p>The image above shows the final product, with my models and models made by other members in the scene as well.
			All models were made in Maya and imported into Unity, where a person can control a first person camera and walk
			around the bunker and forest terrain.;

			<h1>Golden Artist Colors - Website Restructure</h1>

            <h3>View goldenpaints.com to see the live website I helped work on!</h3>
            <p>While doing my college co-op, I worked at Golden Artist Colors for 8 months (between August 2018 and April 2019). During this time, they had plans to restructure their website using
            updated frameworks and compatibility with a new backend and content management system. My task was to recreate or rework the frontend of old pages using Vue.JS as the primary framework. The majority
            of the pages on the website were worked on by me, with my teammate working on the CMS and most backend functionality. These updates are currently up on the site.</p>

			<h1>Unity Project</h1>
			<img src="images/unityDemo.jpg" alt="Flock Chasing Leader" class="printonly" />
			<p>For a project to create a Unity demo utilizing seeking and fleeing forces for simple AI code, I created this.
			It's fairly simple; a group of Pikachu models are chasing a butterfly. The butterfly doesn't move freely but on
			a set path around the terrain, while the Pikachu move in a flock and are not on a set path. They move together
			and keep a set distance apart so they don't all convene to the same spot.</p>
			<img src="images/unityCode.png" alt="Screenshot of Code" class="printonly" />
			<p>This snippet of code (which was made using C#) is for the seekers, and most of this method calls upon other methods that provide the
			necessary forces that create the overall forces of the seekers. Alignment, Cohesion, and Separation are so the
			flock reacts properly, while Leader Following and Seek give them the forces to chase the butterfly.</p>
